Create a Virtual Environment (Important!):

A virtual environment is a way to isolate the project's dependencies, and keep your PC "safe". 
    This is highly recommended to avoid (version) conflicts with other programs you might have.

For Windows:
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate


For macOS / Linux:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

After running the activation command, you should see (venv) at the beginning of your terminal 
    prompt. This indicates that the virtual environment is active.

If you close the terminal, you'll need to re-activate the virtual environment the next time you
    work on the project.


Install Dependencies:
    With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

This command reads the requirements.txt file (which lists all the necessary packages) 
    and installs them into your virtual environment. 


Troubleshooting: 
1. Running scripts is disabled on your system: 
    -> run the following command first: 
        "Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process"
            -> Follow steps above as normal.

        Example.
        PS C:\Users\acast\InsuraunceCostCaseStudy>  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
        PS C:\Users\acast\InsuraunceCostCaseStudy>  python -m venv venv
        PS C:\Users\acast\InsuraunceCostCaseStudy>  venv\Scripts\activate
        (venv) PS C:\Users\acast\InsuraunceCostCaseStudy> pip install -r requirements.txt
